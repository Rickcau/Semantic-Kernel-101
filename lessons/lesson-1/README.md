It's important to understand why and SDK is needed 

## Module 1 - Why Semantic Kernel? 
Today's AI models can easily generate messages and images for users. While this is helpful when building a simple chat app, it is not enough to build fully automated AI agents that can automate business processes and empower users to achieve more. To do so, you would need a framework that can take the responses from these models and use them to call existing code to actually do something productive.

With Semantic Kernel, we've done just that. We've created an SDK that allows you to easily describe your existing code to AI models so they can request that they be called. Afterwards, Semantic Kernel does the heavy lifting of translating the model's response into a call to your code.






A lesson plan outlines what you’ll teach in a given lesson and provides justification for why you’re teaching it.
Every lesson plan needs an objective, relevant standards, a timeline of activities, an overview of the class, assessments, and required instructional materials.
Overplan in case your lesson ends early and tailor your plans to suit the needs of your students.
