#Lesson-1

A lesson plan outlines what you’ll teach in a given lesson and provides justification for why you’re teaching it.
Every lesson plan needs an objective, relevant standards, a timeline of activities, an overview of the class, assessments, and required instructional materials.
Overplan in case your lesson ends early and tailor your plans to suit the needs of your students.
