# Lesson 2 - Prompts and Plugins
## Chat Completion Message Structure â€“ Why is it so important?
Before we get into the prompts itâ€™s important to understand the Chat Completion API structures, specifically the messages array.  1st â€“ Iâ€™d recommend that you take a close look at the [Azure OpenAI REST API reference document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference).  2nd â€“ I would recommend that you play with the Chat Completion endpoints using Postman.  You can find a Postman Chat Completion Collection in my [AI Fundamentals repo](https://github.com/Rickcau/AI-Fundamentals).
