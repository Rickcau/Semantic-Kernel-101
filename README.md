## Goal
- To provide users with simple learning plans that allow you to quickly learn Semantic Kernel starting with the basic to advanced concepts 
- Use a lesson based approach for understanding of concepts that allow you to progressively learn advanced concepts 
- Allow much faster adoption of AI using by leveraging proven practices
- Provide users with reusable building blocks resulting in ability to deliver solutions faster

## Lessons
### [Lesson 1 - Why Semantic Kernel? - Building our first App?](./lessons/lesson-1/README.md)
In this lesson we cover the fundimental concepts of Semantic Kernel and what is needed to build your first console app.

### [Lesson 2 - Plugins & Prompts](./lessons/lesson-2/README.md)
In this lesson I reiterate the importance of understanding the ChatCompletion Message structure then we dive right into SK Plugins and how they are the body of your AI solution.  We will drill deeper into SK Prompts and the various ways you can use prompts and how everything is a Plugin and why this is important. 

We are building a foundation of Semantic Kernel Concepts that will set you up for success with your AI engagements.

## [Solutions](/solutions/README.md)
Each lesson will have a separate project in the Semantic-Kernel-101.sln.  If you need to see a working example for the lesson you can find them here.  The idea is that you do the homework, put hands on the keyboard and you create the project that that covers the topics outlined in each lesson.  If you need a little help you can use this solution to get you moving.
