- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and Generative AI
   The RAG pattern is one of the most important patterns in use today.
     Retrieval  = Retrieve inforamtion from a data source
     Augment    = Inject the retrieved data into the prompt
     Generation = Allow the LLM to generation responses based on the retrieved data
