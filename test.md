# Product Requirements Document\n\n## Overview\nThe GenAI Chat Bot Solution serves as a Reverse Engineering Project Planning Assistant. It uses Semantic Kernel Chat Completion Agents to guide users through project planning by asking targeted questions and generating structured documentation based on user responses.\n\n## Target Users\n- **Program Managers**: To assist in planning and managing technical projects.\n- **Software Developers**: To guide technical planning and provide relevant documentation support.\n\n## Core Problem\nProgram managers and developers often face challenges in reverse-engineering requirements and planning projects effectively. This solution streamlines the process by providing structured guidance and generating comprehensive documentation.\n\n## Features\n\n### Frontend\n- **Input Area**:\n  - Located at the bottom of the screen:\n    - Text field for user queries.\n    - Submit button on the right.\n    - Clear button to reset input.\n- **Chat History Display**:\n  - Scrollable area showing:\n    - User queries aligned to the right.\n    - API responses aligned to the left.\n- **Hidden Sidebar**:\n  - Slides out on mouse hover over the left area.\n  - Displays chat history for the session (grouped by day).\n  - Includes an icon to start a new chat session.\n- **Settings Dialog**:\n  - Accessible via a settings icon at the bottom of the sidebar.\n  - Displays configuration options when clicked.\n\n### Backend\n- **API Architecture**:\n  - Built with ASP.NET traditional controllers.\n  - Utilizes Semantic Kernel Chat Completion Agents for GenAI capabilities.\n- **Prompt Chain**:\n  - Guides users through structured questions (like the assistant's process).\n  - Generates structured documentation, including PRD, frontend, backend, API, database schema, etc.\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n### Frontend\n- **Framework**: Next.js version 18 with TypeScript.\n- **UI Library**: Material-UI or a similar component library.\n\n### Backend\n- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core traditional controllers.\n- **Features**:\n  - Semantic Kernel integration for Chat Completions Agents.\n  - REST API endpoints to handle chat and documentation requests.\n\n### Scalability\n- Designed for multiple concurrent users.\n- Caching for chat histories to optimize performance.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Define backend architecture in detail.\n2. Outline the database schema for chat history and user settings.\n3. Determine state management strategy for frontend.\n4. Specify DevOps setup for deployment.\n\n---\n\n# Frontend Documentation\n\n## Framework\n**Next.js version 18 with TypeScript**\n\n## UI Features\n- **Input Area**:\n  - Located at the bottom of the screen with:\n    - A text field for user queries.\n    - A submit button on the right.\n    - A clear button to reset input.\n- **Chat History Display**:\n  - Scrollable area showing:\n    - User queries aligned to the right.\n    - API responses aligned to the left.\n- **Hidden Sidebar**:\n  - Slides out on mouse hover over the left area.\n  - Displays chat history for the session (grouped by day).\n  - Includes an icon to start a new chat session.\n- **Settings Dialog**:\n  - Accessible via a settings icon at the bottom of the sidebar.\n  - Displays configuration options when clicked.\n\n## UI Library\n**Material-UI** or a similar component library.\n\n## Additional Notes\n- Use server-side rendering (SSR) for initial page load performance.\n- Ensure responsive design to support desktop and mobile layouts.\n\n---\n\n# Backend Documentation\n\n## Framework\n**ASP.NET Core using traditional controllers**\n\n## Features\n- **API Endpoints**:\n  - **Chat Completion Endpoint**:\n    - Receives user input.\n    - Processes the input using Semantic Kernel Chat Completion Agents.\n    - Returns structured responses to the frontend.\n  - **Documentation Generation Endpoint**:\n    - Guides users through structured prompts.\n    - Generates documentation files (e.g., PRD, frontend, backend).\n\n- **Prompt Chain**:\n  - Designed to ask targeted questions.\n  - Stores user responses in a session-based format.\n\n- **Session Management**:\n  - Tracks user sessions to provide consistent conversations.\n  - Groups chat histories by day.\n\n## Semantic Kernel Integration\n- **Chat Completions Agents**:\n  - Implemented to handle natural language understanding and response generation.\n  - Optimized for project planning and documentation tasks.\n\n## Additional Notes\n- Use dependency injection to manage services.\n- Implement logging and exception handling for API stability.
